        is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact insight into the
        theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a general scientific and
        philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are
        not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics.
        The work presumes a standard of education corresponding to that of a
        university matriculation examination, and, despite the shortness of the
        book, a fair amount of patience and force of will on the part of the
        reader. The author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour to
        present the main ideas in the simplest and most intelligible form, and
        on the whole, in the sequence and connection in which they actually
        originated. In the interest of clearness, it appeared to me inevitable
        that I should repeat myself frequently, without paying the slightest
        attention to the elegance of the presentation. I adhered scrupulously to
        the precept of that brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann,
        according to whom matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor and
        to the cobbler. I make no pretence of having withheld from the reader
        difficulties which are inherent to the subject. On the other hand, I
        have purposely treated the empirical physical foundations of the theory
        in a "step-motherly" fashion, so that readers unfamiliar with physics
        may not feel like the wanderer who was unable to see the forest for the
        trees. May the book bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive
        thought! December, 1916 A. EINSTEIN Albert Einstein 5 Part I The Special
        Theory of Relativity Physical Meaning of Geometrical Propositions In
        your schooldays most of you who read this book made acquaintance with
        the noble building of Euclid's geometry, and you remember — perhaps with
        more respect than love — the magnificent structure, on the lofty
        staircase of which you were chased about for uncounted hours by
        conscientious teachers. By reason of our past experience, you would
        certainly regard everyone with disdain who should pronounce even the
        most out-of-the-way proposition of this science to be untrue. But
        perhaps this feeling of proud certainty would leave you immediately if
        some one were to ask you: "What, then, do you mean by the assertion that
        these propositions are true?" Let us proceed to give this question a
        little consideration. Geometry sets out form certain conceptions such as
        "plane," "point," and "straight line," with which we are able to
        associate more or less definite ideas, and from certain simple
        propositions (axioms) which, in virtue of these ideas, we are inclined
        to accept as "true." Then, on the basis of a logical process, the
        justification of which we feel ourselves compelled to admit, all
        remaining propositions are shown to follow from those axioms, i.e. they
        are proven. A proposition is then correct ("true") when it has been
        derived in the recognised manner from the axioms. The question of
        "truth" of the individual geometrical propositions is thus reduced to
        one of the "truth" of the axioms. Now it has long been known that the
        last question is not only unanswerable by the methods of geometry, but
        that it is in itself entirely without meaning. We cannot ask whether it
        is true that only one Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity straight
        line goes through two points. We can only say that Euclidean geometry
        deals with things called "straight lines," to each of which is ascribed
        the property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it.
        The concept "true" does not tally with the assertions of pure geometry,
        because by the word "true" we are eventually in the habit of designating
        always the correspondence with a "real" object; geometry, however, is
        not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved in it to objects
        of experience, but only with the logical connection of these ideas among
        themselves. It is not difficult to understand why, in spite of this, we
        feel constrained to call the propositions of geometry "true."
        Geometrical ideas correspond to more or less exact objects in nature,
        and these last are undoubtedly the exclusive cause of the genesis of
        those ideas. Geometry ought to refrain from such a course, in order to
        give to its structure the largest possible logical unity. The practice,
        for example, of seeing in a "distance" two marked positions on a
        practically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply in our habit
        of thought. We are accustomed further to regard three points as being
        situated on a straight line, if their apparent positions can be made to
        coincide for observation with one eye, under suitable choice of our
        place of observation. If, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we now
        supplement the propositions of Euclidean geometry by the single
        proposition that two points on a practically rigid body always
        correspond to the same distance (line-interval), independently of any
        changes in position to which we may subject the body, the propositions
        of Euclidean geometry then resolve themselves into propositions on the
        possible relative position of practically rigid bodies.1) Geometry which
        has been supplemented in this way is then to be treated as a branch of
        physics. We can now legitimately ask as to the "truth" of geometrical
        propositions interpreted in this way, since we are justified in asking
        whether these propositions are satisfied for those real things we have
        associated with the geometrical ideas. In less exact terms we can
        express this by saying that by the "truth" of a geometrical proposition
        in this sense we understand its validity for a construction with rule
        and compasses. Of course the conviction of the "truth" of geometrical
        propositions in this sense is founded exclusively on rather incomplete
        experience. For the present we shall assume the "truth" of the
        geometrical propositions, then at a later stage (in the general theory
        of Albert Einstein 7 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity
        relativity) we shall see that this "truth" is limited, and we shall
        consider the extent of its limitation. Notes 1) It follows that a
        natural object is associated also with a straight line. Three points A,
        B and C on a rigid body thus lie in a straight line when the points A
        and C being given, B is chosen such that the sum of the distances A B
        and BC is as short as possible. This incomplete suggestion will suffice
        for the present purpose. Albert Einstein 8 Part I: The Special Theory of
        Relativity The System of Co-ordinates On the basis of the physical
        interpretation of distance which has been indicated, we are also in a
        position to establish the distance between two points on a rigid body by
        means of measurements. For this purpose we require a " distance " (rod
        S) which is to be used once and for all, and which we employ as a
        standard measure. If, now, A and B are two points on a rigid body, we
        can construct the line joining them according to the rules of geometry ;
        then, starting from A, we can mark off the distance S time after time
        until we reach B. The number of these operations required is the
        numerical measure of the distance AB. This is the basis of all
        measurement of length. 1) Every description of the scene of an event or
        of the position of an object in space is based on the specification of
        the point on a rigid body (body of reference) with which that event or
        object coincides. This applies not only to scientific description, but
        also to everyday life. If I analyse the place specification " Times
        Square, New York," [A] I arrive at the following result. The earth is
        the rigid body to which the specification of place refers; " Times
        Square, New York," is a well-defined point, to which a name has been
        assigned, and with which the event coincides in space.2) This primitive
        method of place specification deals only with places on the surface of
        rigid bodies, and is dependent on the existence of points on this
        surface which are distinguishable from each other. But we can free
        ourselves from both of these limitations without altering the nature of
        our specification of position. If, for instance, a cloud is hovering
        over Times Square, then we can determine its position relative to the
        surface of the earth by erecting a pole perpendicularly on the Square,
        so that it reaches the cloud. The length of the pole measured with the
        standard measuring-rod, combined with the specification of the position
        of the foot of the pole, supplies us with a complete place
        specification. On the basis of this illustration, we are able to see the
        manner in which a refinement of the conception of position has been
        developed. Albert Einstein 9 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity
        (a) We imagine the rigid body, to which the place specification is
        referred, supplemented in such a manner that the object whose position
        we require is reached by. the completed rigid body. (b) In locating the
        position of the object, we make use of a number (here the length of the
        pole measured with the measuring-rod) instead of designated points of
        reference. (c) We speak of the height of the cloud even when the pole
        which reaches the cloud has not been erected. By means of optical
        observations of the cloud from different positions on the ground, and
        taking into account the properties of the propagation of light, we
        determine the length of the pole we should have required in order to
        reach the cloud. From this consideration we see that it will be
        advantageous if, in the description of position, it should be possible
        by means of numerical measures to make ourselves independent of the
        existence of marked positions (possessing names) on the rigid body of
        reference. In the physics of measurement this is attained by the
        application of the Cartesian system of co-ordinates. This consists of
        three plane surfaces perpendicular to each other and rigidly attached to
        a rigid body. Referred to a system of co-ordinates, the scene of any
        event will be determined (for the main part) by the specification of the
        lengths of the three perpendiculars or coordinates (x, y, z) which can
        be dropped from the scene of the event to those three plane surfaces.
        The lengths of these three perpendiculars can be determined by a series
        of manipulations with rigid measuring-rods performed according to the
        rules and methods laid down by Euclidean geometry. In practice, the
        rigid surfaces which constitute the system of co-ordinates are generally
        not available ; furthermore, the magnitudes of the co-ordinates are not
        actually determined by constructions with rigid rods, but by indirect
        means. If the results of physics and astronomy are to maintain their
        clearness, the physical meaning of specifications of position must
        always be sought in accordance with the above considerations. 3) Albert
        Einstein 10 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity We thus obtain the
        following result: Every description of events in space involves the use
        of a rigid body to which such events have to be referred. The resulting
        relationship takes for granted that the laws of Euclidean geometry hold
        for "distances;" the "distance" being represented physically by means of
        the convention of two marks on a rigid body. Notes 1) Here we have
        assumed that there is nothing left over i.e. that the measurement gives
        a whole number. This difficulty is got over by the use of divided
        measuring-rods, the introduction of which does not demand any
        fundamentally new method. [A] Einstein used "Potsdamer Platz, Berlin" in
        the original text. In the authorised translation this was supplemented
        with "Tranfalgar Square, London". We have changed this to "Times Square,
        New York", as this is the most well known/identifiable location to
        English speakers in the present day. [Note by the janitor.] 2) It is not
        necessary here to investigate further the significance of the expression
        "coincidence in space." This conception is sufficiently obvious to
        ensure that differences of opinion are scarcely likely to arise as to
        its applicability in practice. 3) A refinement and modification of these
        views does not become necessary until we come to deal with the general
        theory of relativity, treated in the second part of this book. Albert
        Einstein 11 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity Space and Time in
        Classical Mechanics The purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies
        change their position in space with "time." I should load my conscience
        with grave sins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were I to
        formulate the aims of mechanics in this way, without serious reflection
        and detailed explanations. Let us proceed to disclose these sins. It is
        not clear what is to be understood here by "position" and "space." I
        stand at the window of a railway carriage which is travelling uniformly,
        and drop a stone on the embankment, without throwing it. Then,
        disregarding the influence of the air resistance, I see the stone
        descend in a straight line. A pedestrian who observes the misdeed from
        the footpath notices that the stone falls to earth in a parabolic curve.
        I now ask: Do the "positions" traversed by the stone lie "in reality" on
        a straight line or on a parabola? Moreover, what is meant here by motion
        "in space" ? From the considerations of the previous section the answer
        is self-evident. In the first place we entirely shun the vague word
        "space," of which, we must honestly acknowledge, we cannot form the
        slightest conception, and we replace it by "motion relative to a
        practically rigid body of reference." The positions relative to the body
        of reference (railway carriage or embankment) have already been defined
        in detail in the preceding section. If instead of " body of reference "
        we insert " system of co-ordinates," which is a useful idea for
        mathematical description, we are in a position to say : The stone
        traverses a straight line relative to a system of coordinates rigidly
        attached to the carriage, but relative to a system of co-ordinates
        rigidly attached to the ground (embankment) it describes a parabola.
        With the aid of this example it is clearly seen that there is no such
        thing as an independently existing trajectory (lit. "pathcurve" 1)), but
        only a trajectory relative to a particular body of reference. Albert
        Einstein 12 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity In order to have a
        complete description of the motion, we must specify how the body alters
        its position with time ; i.e. for every point on the trajectory it must
        be stated at what time the body is situated there. These data must be
        supplemented by such a definition of time that, in virtue of this
        definition, these time-values can be regarded essentially as magnitudes
        (results of measurements) capable of observation. If we take our stand
        on the ground of classical mechanics, we can satisfy this requirement
        for our illustration in the following manner. We imagine two clocks of
        identical construction ; the man at the railway-carriage window is
        holding one of them, and the man on the footpath the other. Each of the
        observers determines the position on his own reference-body occupied by
        the stone at each tick of the clock he is holding in his hand. In this
        connection we have not taken account of the inaccuracy involved by the
        finiteness of the velocity of propagation of light. With this and with a
        second difficulty prevailing here we shall have to deal in detail later.
        Notes 1) That is, a curve along which the body moves. Albert Einstein 13
        Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity The Galileian System of
        Co-ordinates As is well known, the fundamental law of the mechanics of
        Galilei-Newton, which is known as the law of inertia, can be stated
        thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a
        state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. This law not only
        says something about the motion of the bodies, but it also indicates the
        reference-bodies or systems of coordinates, permissible in mechanics,
        which can be used in mechanical description. The visible fixed stars are
        bodies for which the law of inertia certainly holds to a high degree of
        approximation. Now if we use a system of co-ordinates which is rigidly
        attached to the earth, then, relative to this system, every fixed star
        describes a circle of immense radius in the course of an astronomical
        day, a result which is opposed to the statement of the law of inertia.
        So that if we adhere to this law we must refer these motions only to
        systems of coordinates relative to which the fixed stars do not move in
        a circle. A system of co-ordinates of which the state of motion is such
        that the law of inertia holds relative to it is called a " Galileian
        system of co-ordinates." The laws of the mechanics of Galflei-Newton can
        be regarded as valid only for a Galileian system of co-ordinates. Albert
        Einstein 14 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity The Principle of
        Relativity (in the restricted sense) In order to attain the greatest
        possible clearness, let us return to our example of the railway carriage
        supposed to be travelling uniformly. We call its motion a uniform
        translation ("uniform" because it is of constant velocity and direction,
        " translation " because although the carriage changes its position
        relative to the embankment yet it does not rotate in so doing). Let us
        imagine a raven flying through the air in such a manner that its motion,
        as observed from the embankment, is uniform and in a straight line. If
        we were to observe the flying raven from the moving railway carriage. we
        should find that the motion of the raven would be one of different
        velocity and direction, but that it would still be uniform and in a
        straight line. Expressed in an abstract manner we may say : If a mass m
        is moving uniformly in a straight line with respect to a co-ordinate
        system K, then it will also be moving uniformly and in a straight line
        relative to a second co-ordinate system K1 provided that the latter is
        executing a uniform translatory motion with respect to K. In accordance
        with the discussion contained in the preceding section, it follows that:
        If K is a Galileian co-ordinate system. then every other coordinate
        system K' is a Galileian one, when, in relation to K, it is in a
        condition of uniform motion of translation. Relative to K1 the
        mechanical laws of Galilei-Newton hold good exactly as they do with
        respect to K. We advance a step farther in our generalisation when we
        express the tenet thus: If, relative to K, K1 is a uniformly moving
        co-ordinate system devoid of rotation, then natural phenomena run their
        course with respect to K1 according to exactly the same general laws as
        with respect to K. This statement is called the principle of relativity
        (in the restricted sense). Albert Einstein 15 Part I: The Special Theory
        of Relativity As long as one was convinced that all natural phenomena
        were capable of representation with the help of classical mechanics,
        there was no need to doubt the validity of this principle of relativity.
        But in view of the more recent development of electrodynamics and optics
        it became more and more evident that classical mechanics affords an
        insufficient foundation for the physical description of all natural
        phenomena. At this juncture the question of the validity of the
        principle of relativity became ripe for discussion, and it did not
        appear impossible that the answer to this question might be in the
        negative. Nevertheless, there are two general facts which at the outset
        speak very much in favour of the validity of the principle of
        relativity. Even though classical mechanics does not supply us with a
        sufficiently broad basis for the theoretical presentation of all
        physical phenomena, still we must grant it a considerable measure of "
        truth," since it supplies us with the actual motions of the heavenly
        bodies with a delicacy of detail little short of wonderful. The
        principle of relativity must therefore apply with great accuracy in the
        domain of mechanics. But that a principle of such broad generality
        should hold with such exactness in one domain of phenomena, and yet
        should be invalid for another, is a priori not very probable. We now
        proceed to the second argument, to which, moreover, we shall return
        later. If the principle of relativity (in the restricted sense) does not
        hold, then the Galileian co-ordinate systems K, K1, K2, etc., which are
        moving uniformly relative to each other, will not be equivalent for the
        description of natural phenomena. In this case we should be constrained
        to believe that natural laws are capable of being formulated in a
        particularly simple manner, and of course only on condition that, from
        amongst all possible Galileian co-ordinate systems, we should have
        chosen one (K0) of a particular state of motion as our body of
        reference. We should then be justified (because of its merits for the
        description of natural phenomena) in calling this system " absolutely at
        rest," and all other Galileian systems K " in motion." If, for instance,
        our embankment were the system K0 then our railway carriage would be a
        system K, relative to which less simple laws would hold than with
        respect to K0. This diminished simplicity would be due to the fact that
        the carriage K would be in motion (i.e."really")with respect to K0. In
        the general laws of nature which have been formulated with reference to
        K, the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the carriage would
        necessarily play a part. We should expect, for instance, that the note
        emitted by an Albert Einstein 16 Part I: The Special Theory of
        Relativity organpipe placed with its axis parallel to the direction of
        travel would be different from that emitted if the axis of the pipe were
        placed perpendicular to this direction. Now in virtue of its motion in
        an orbit round the sun, our earth is comparable with a railway carriage
        travelling with a velocity of about 30 kilometres per second. If the
        principle of relativity were not valid we should therefore expect that
        the direction of motion of the earth at any moment would enter into the
        laws of nature, and also that physical systems in their behaviour would
        be dependent on the orientation in space with respect to the earth. For
        owing to the alteration in direction of the velocity of revolution of
        the earth in the course of a year, the earth cannot be at rest relative
        to the hypothetical system K0 throughout the whole year. However, the
        most careful observations have never revealed such anisotropic
        properties in terrestrial physical space, i.e. a physical
        non-equivalence of different directions. This is very powerful argument
        in favour of the principle of relativity. Albert Einstein 17 Part I: The
        Special Theory of Relativity The Theorem of the Addition of Velocities
        Employed in Classical Mechanics Let us suppose our old friend the
        railway carriage to be travelling along the rails with a constant
        velocity v, and that a man traverses the length of the carriage in the
        direction of travel with a velocity w. How quickly or, in other words,
        with what velocity W does the man advance relative to the embankment
        during the process ? The only possible answer seems to result from the
        following consideration: If the man were to stand still for a second, he
        would advance relative to the embankment through a distance v equal
        numerically to the velocity of the carriage. As a consequence of his
        walking, however, he traverses an additional distance w relative to the
        carriage, and hence also relative to the embankment, in this second, the
        distance w being numerically equal to the velocity with which he is
        walking. Thus in total be covers the distance W=v+w relative to the
        embankment in the second considered. We shall see later that this
        result, which expresses the theorem of the addition of velocities
        employed in classical mechanics, cannot be maintained ; in other words,
        the law that we have just written down does not hold in reality. For the
        time being, however, we shall assume its correctness. ! Albert Einstein
        18 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity The Apparent Incompatibility
        of the Law of Propagation of Light with the Principle of Relativity
        There is hardly a simpler law in physics than that according to which
        light is propagated in empty space. Every child at school knows, or
        believes he knows, that this propagation takes place in straight lines
        with a velocity c= 300,000 km./sec. At all events we know with great
        exactness that this velocity is the same for all colours, because if
        this were not the case, the minimum of emission would not be observed
        simultaneously for different colours during the eclipse of a fixed star
        by its dark neighbour. By means of similar considerations based on
        observa- tions of double stars, the Dutch astronomer De Sitter was also
        able to show that the velocity of propagation of light cannot depend on
        the velocity of motion of the body emitting the light. The assumption
        that this velocity of propagation is dependent on the direction "in
        space" is in itself improbable. In short, let us assume that the simple
        law of the constancy of the velocity of light c (in vacuum) is
        justifiably believed by the child at school. Who would imagine that this
        simple law has plunged the conscientiously thoughtful physicist into the
        greatest intellectual difficulties? Let us consider how these
        difficulties arise. Of course we must refer the process of the
        propagation of light (and indeed every other process) to a rigid
        reference-body (co-ordinate system). As such a system let us again
        choose our embankment. We shall imagine the air above it to have been
        removed. If a ray of light be sent along the embankment, we see from the
        above that the tip of the ray will be transmitted with the velocity c
        relative to the embankment. Now let us suppose that our railway carriage
        is again travelling along the railway lines with the velocity v, and
        that its direction is the same as that of the ray of light, but its
        velocity of course much less. Let us inquire about the velocity of
        propagation of the ray of light relative to the carriage. It is obvious
        that we can here apply the consideration of the previous section, since
        the ray of Albert Einstein 19 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity
        light plays the part of the man walking along relatively to the
        carriage. The velocity w of the man relative to the embankment is here
        replaced by the velocity of light relative to the embankment. w is the
        required velocity of light with respect to the carriage, and we have w =
        c-v. The velocity of propagation ot a ray of light relative to the
        carriage thus comes cut smaller than c. But this result comes into
        conflict with the principle of relativity set forth in Section V. For,
        like every other general law of nature, the law of the transmission of
        light in vacuo [in vacuum] must, according to the principle of
        relativity, be the same for the railway carriage as reference-body as
        when the rails are the body of reference. But, from our above
        consideration, this would appear to be impossible. If every ray of light
        is propagated relative to the embankment with the velocity c, then for
        this reason it would appear that another law of propagation of light
        must necessarily hold with respect to the carriage — a result
        contradictory to the principle of relativity. In view of this dilemma
        there appears to be nothing else for it than to abandon either the
        principle of relativity or the simple law of the propagation of light in
        vacuo. Those of you who have carefully followed the preceding discussion
        are almost sure to expect that we should retain the principle of
        relativity, which appeals so convincingly to the intellect because it is
        so natural and simple. The law of the propagation of light in vacuo
        would then have to be replaced by a more complicated law conformable to
        the principle of relativity. The development of theoretical physics
        shows, however, that we cannot pursue this course. The epoch-making
        theoretical investigations of H. A. Lorentz on the electrodynamical and
        optical phenomena connected with moving bodies show that experience in
        this domain leads conclusively to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena,
        of which the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo is a
        necessary consequence. Prominent theoretical physicists were theref ore
        more inclined to reject the principle of relativity, in spite of the
        fact that no empirical data had been found which were contradictory to
        this principle. Albert Einstein 20 Part I: The Special Theory of
        Relativity At this juncture the theory of relativity entered the arena.
        As a result of an analysis of the physical conceptions of time and
        space, it became evident that in realily there is not the least
        incompatibilitiy between the principle of relativity and the law of
        propagation of light, and that by systematically holding fast to both
        these laws a logically rigid theory could be arrived at. This theory has
        been called the special theory of relativity to distinguish it from the
        extended theory, with which we shall deal later. In the following pages
        we shall present the fundamental ideas of the special theory of
        relativity. Albert Einstein 21 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity
        On the Idea of Time in Physics Lightning has struck the rails on our
        railway embankment at two places A and B far distant from each other. I
        make the additional assertion that these two lightning flashes occurred
        simultaneously. If I ask you whether there is sense in this statement,
        you will answer my question with a decided "Yes." But if I now approach
        you with the request to explain to me the sense of the statement more
        precisely, you find after some consideration that the answer to this
        question is not so easy as it appears at first sight. After some time
        perhaps the following answer would occur to you: "The significance of
        the statement is clear in itself and needs no further explanation; of
        course it would require some consideration if I were to be commissioned
        to determine by observations whether in the actual case the two events
        took place simultaneously or not." I cannot be satisfied with this
        answer for the following reason. Supposing that as a result of ingenious
        considerations an able meteorologist were to discover that the lightning
        must always strike the places A and B simultaneously, then we should be
        faced with the task of testing whether or not this theoretical result is
        in accordance with the reality. We encounter the same difficulty with
        all physical statements in which the conception " simultaneous " plays a
        part. The concept does not exist for the physicist until he has the
        possibility of discovering whether or not it is fulfilled in an actual
        case. We thus require a definition of simultaneity such that this
        definition supplies us with the method by means of which, in the present
        case, he can decide by experiment whether or not both the lightning
        strokes occurred simultaneously. As long as this requirement is not
        satisfied, I allow myself to be deceived as a physicist (and of course
        the same applies if I am not a physicist), when I imagine that I am able
        to attach a meaning to the statement of simultaneity. (I would ask the
        reader not to proceed farther until he is fully convinced on this
        point.) After thinking the matter over for some time you then offer the
        following suggestion with which to test simultaneity. By measuring along
        the rails, the connecting line AB should be Albert Einstein 22 Part I:
        The Special Theory of Relativity measured up and an observer placed at
        the mid-point M of the distance AB. This observer should be supplied
        with an arrangement (e.g. two mirrors inclined at 900) which allows him
        visually to observe both places A and B at the same time. If the
        observer perceives the two flashes of lightning at the same time, then
        they are simultaneous. I am very pleased with this suggestion, but for
        all that I cannot regard the matter as quite settled, because I feel
        constrained to raise the following objection: "Your definition would
        certainly be right, if only I knew that the light by means of which the
        observer at M perceives the lightning flashes travels along M with the
        same velocity as along the length B M. the length A But an examination
        of this supposition would only be possible if we already had at our
        disposal the means of measuring time. It would thus appear as though we
        were moving here in a logical circle." After further consideration you
        cast a somewhat disdainful glance at me — and rightly so — and you
        declare: "I maintain my previous definition nevertheless, because in
        reality it assumes absolutely nothing about light. There is only one
        demand to be made of the definition of simultaneity, namely, that in
        every real case it must supply us with an empirical decision as to
        whether or not the conception that has to be defined is fulfilled. That
        my definition satisfies this demand is indisputable. M as for the That
        light requires the same time to traverse the path A M is in reality
        neither a supposition nor a hypothesis about the path B physical nature
        of light, but a stipulation which I can make of my own freewill in order
        to arrive at a definition of simultaneity." It is clear that this
        definition can be used to give an exact meaning not only to two events,
        but to as many events as we care to choose, and independently of the
        positions of the scenes of the events with respect to the body of
        reference 1) (here the railway embankment). We are thus led also to a
        definition of " time " in physics. For this purpose we suppose that
        clocks of identical construction are placed at the points A, B and C of
        the railway line (co-ordinate system) and that they are set in such a
        manner that the positions of their pointers are simultaneously (in the
        above sense) the same. Under these conditions we understand by the "
        time " of an event the reading (position of the hands) of that one of
        these clocks which is in the immediate vicinity (in space) of the event.
        In this manner a time-value is associated with every event which is
        essentially capable of observation. Albert Einstein 23 Part I: The
        Special Theory of Relativity This stipulation contains a further
        physical hypothesis, the validity of which will hardly be doubted
        without empirical evidence to the contrary. It has been assumed that all
        these clocks go at the same rate if they are of identical construction.
        Stated more exactly: When two clocks arranged at rest in different
        places of a reference-body are set in such a manner that a particular
        position of the pointers of the one clock is simultaneous (in the above
        sense) with the same position, of the pointers of the other clock, then
        identical " settings " are always simultaneous (in the sense of the
        above definition). Footnotes 1) We suppose further, that, when three
        events A, B and C occur in different places in such a manner that A is
        simultaneous with B and B is simultaneous with C (simultaneous in the
        sense of the above definition), then the criterion for the simultaneity
        of the pair of events A, C is also satisfied. This assumption is a
        physical hypothesis about the the of propagation of light: it must
        certainly be fulfilled if we are to maintain the law of the constancy of
        the velocity of light in vacuo. Albert Einstein 24 Part I: The Special
        Theory of Relativity The Relativity of Simulatneity Up to now our
        considerations have been referred to a particular body of reference,
        which we have styled a " railway embankment." We suppose a very long
        train travelling along the rails with the constant velocity v and in the
        direction indicated in Fig 1. People travelling in this train will with
        a vantage view the train as a rigid reference-body (co-ordinate system);
        they regard all events in reference to the train. Then every event which
        takes place along the line also takes place at a particular point of the
        train. Also the definition of simultaneity can be given relative to the
        train in exactly the same way as with respect to the embankment. As a
        natural consequence, however, the following question arises : Are two
        events (e.g. the two strokes of lightning A and B) which are
        simultaneous with reference to the railway embankment also simultaneous
        relatively to the train? We shall show directly that the answer must be
        in the negative. When we say that the lightning strokes A and B are
        simultaneous with respect to be embankment, we mean: the rays of light
        emitted at the places A and B, where the lightning occurs, meet each
        other at the mid-point M of the length A Albert Einstein B of the
        embankment. But 25 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity the events A
        and B also correspond to positions A and B on the train. Let M1 be the
        midpoint of the distance A B on the travelling train. Just when the
        flashes (as judged from the embankment) of lightning occur, this point
        M1 naturally coincides with the point M but it moves towards the right
        in the diagram with the velocity v of the train. If an observer sitting
        in the position M1 in the train did not possess this velocity, then he
        would remain permanently at M, and the light rays emitted by the flashes
        of lightning A and B would reach him simultaneously, i.e. they would
        meet just where he is situated. Now in reality (considered with
        reference to the railway embankment) he is hastening towards the beam of
        light coming from B, whilst he is riding on ahead of the beam of light
        coming from A. Hence the observer will see the beam of light emitted
        from B earlier than he will see that emitted from A. Observers who take
        the railway train as their reference-body must therefore come to the
        conclusion that the lightning flash B took place earlier than the
        lightning flash A. We thus arrive at the important result: Events which
        are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not simultaneous
        with respect to the train, and vice versa (relativity of simultaneity).
        Every reference-body (coordinate system) has its own particular time ;
        unless we are told the reference-body to which the statement of time
        refers, there is no meaning in a statement of the time of an event. Now
        before the advent of the theory of relativity it had always tacitly been
        assumed in physics that the statement of time had an absolute
        significance, i.e. that it is independent of the state of motion of the
        body of reference. But we have just seen that this assumption is
        incompatible with the most natural definition of simultaneity; if we
        discard this assumption, then the conflict between the law of the
        propagation of light in vacuo and the principle of relativity (developed
        in Section 7) disappears. We were led to that conflict by the
        considerations of Section 6, which are now no longer tenable. In that
        section we concluded that the man in the carriage, who traverses the
        distance w per second relative to the carriage, traverses the same
        distance also with respect to the embankment in each second of time.
        But, according to the foregoing considerations, the time required by a
        particular occurrence with respect to the carriage must not be Albert
        Einstein 26 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity considered equal to
        the duration of the same occurrence as judged from the embankment (as
        reference-body). Hence it cannot be contended that the man in walking
        travels the distance w relative to the railway line in a time which is
        equal to one second as judged from the embankment. Moreover, the
        considerations of Section 6 are based on yet a second assumption, which,
        in the light of a strict consideration, appears to be arbitrary,
        although it was always tacitly made even before the introduction of the
        theory of relativity. Albert Einstein 27 Part I: The Special Theory of
        Relativity On the Relativity of the Conception of Distance Let us
        consider two particular points on the train 1) travelling along the
        embankment with the velocity v, and inquire as to their distance apart.
        We already know that it is necessary to have a body of reference for the
        measurement of a distance, with respect to which body the distance can
        be measured up. It is the simplest plan to use the train itself as
        reference-body (co-ordinate system). An observer in the train measures
        the interval by marking off his measuring-rod in a straight line (e.g.
        along the floor of the carriage) as many times as is necessary to take
        him from the one marked point to the other. Then the number which tells
        us how often the rod has to be laid down is the required distance. It is
        a different matter when the distance has to be judged from the railway
        line. Here the following method suggests itself. If we call A1 and B1
        the two points on the train whose distance apart is required, then both
        of these points are moving with the velocity v along the embankment. In
        the first place we require to determine the points A and B of the
        embankment which are just being passed by the two points A1 and B1 at a
        particular time t — judged from the embankment. These points A and B of
        the embankment can be determined by applying the definition of time
        given in Section 8. The distance between these points A and B is then
        measured by repeated application of thee measuring-rod along the
        embankment. A priori it is by no means certain that this last
        measurement will supply us with the same result as the first. Thus the
        length of the train as measured from the embankment may be different
        from that obtained by measuring in the train itself. This circumstance
        leads us to a second objection which must be raised against the
        apparently obvious consideration of Section 6. Namely, if the man in the
        carriage covers the distance w in a unit of time — measured from the
        train, — then this distance — as measured from the embankment — is not
        necessarily also equal to w. Albert Einstein 28 Part I: The Special
        Theory of Relativity Footnotes 1) e.g. the middle of the first and of
        the hundredth carriage. Albert Einstein 29 Part I: The Special Theory of
        Relativity The Lorentz Transformation The results of the last three
        sections show that the apparent incompatibility of the law of
        propagation of light with the principle of relativity (Section 7) has
        been derived by means of a consideration which borrowed two
        unjustifiable hypotheses from classical mechanics; these are as follows:
        (1) The time-interval (time) between two events is independent of the
        condition of motion of the body of reference. (2) The space-interval
        (distance) between two points of a rigid body is independent of the
        condition of motion of the body of reference. If we drop these
        hypotheses, then the dilemma of Section 7 disappears, because the
        theorem of the addition of velocities derived in Section 6 becomes
        invalid. The possibility presents itself that the law of the propagation
        of light in vacuo may be compatible with the principle of relativity,
        and the question arises: How have we to modify the considerations of
        Section 6 in order to remove the apparent disagreement between these two
        fundamental results of experience? This question leads to a general one.
        In the discussion of Section 6 we have to do with places and times
        relative both to the train and to the embankment. How are we to find the
        place and time of an event in relation to the train, when we know the
        place and time of the event with respect to the railway embankment ? Is
        there a thinkable answer to this question of such a nature that the law
        of transmission of light in vacuo does not contradict the principle of
        relativity ? In other words : Can we conceive of a relation between
        place and time of the individual events relative to both
        reference-bodies, such that every ray of light possesses the velocity of
        transmission c relative to the embankment and relative to the train ?
        This question leads to a quite definite positive answer, and to a
        perfectly definite transformation law for the space-time magnitudes of
        an event when changing over from one body of reference to another.
        Albert Einstein 30 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity Before we
        deal with this, we shall introduce the following incidental
        consideration. Up to the present we have only considered events taking
        place along the embankment, which had mathematically to assume the
        function of a straight line. In the manner indicated in Section 2 we can
        imagine this reference-body supplemented laterally and in a vertical
        direction by means of a framework of rods, so that an event which takes
        place anywhere can be localised with reference to this framework.
        Similarly, we can imagine the train travelling with the velocity v to be
        continued across the whole of space, so that every event, no matter how
        far off it may be, could also be localised with respect to the second
        framework. Without committing any fundamental error, we can disregard
        the fact that in reality these frameworks would continually interfere
        with each other, owing to the impenetrability of solid bodies. In every
        such framework we imagine three surfaces perpendicular to each other
        marked out, and designated as " coordinate planes " (" co-ordinate
        system "). A co-ordinate system K then corresponds to the embankment,
        and a co-ordinate system K' to the train. An event, wherever it may have
        taken place, would be fixed in space with respect to K by the three
        perpendiculars x, y, z on the co-ordinate planes, and with regard to
        time by a time value t. Relative to K1, the same event would be fixed in
        respect of space and time by corresponding values x1, y1, z1, t1, which
        of course are not identical with x, y, z, t. It has already been set
        forth in detail how these magnitudes are to be regarded as results of
        physical measurements. Obviously our problem can be exactly formulated
        in the following manner. What are the values x1, y1, z1, t1, of an event
        with respect to K1, when the magnitudes x, y, z, t, of the same event
        with respect to K are given ? The relations must be so chosen that the
        law of the transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied for one and the
        same ray of light (and of course for every ray) with respect to K and
        K1. For the relative orientation in space of the coordinate systems
        indicated in the diagram (Fig. 2), this problem is solved by means of
        the equations : Albert Einstein 31 Part I: The Special Theory of
        Relativity y1 = y z1 = z This system of equations is known as the "
        Lorentz transformation." 1) If in place of the law of transmission of
        light we had taken as our basis the tacit assumptions of the older
        mechanics as to the absolute character of times and lengths, then
        instead of the above we should have obtained the following equations: x1
        = x - vt y1 = y z1 = z t1 = t This system of equations is often termed
        the " Galilei transformation." The Galilei transformation can be
        obtained from the Lorentz transformation by substituting an infinitely
        large value for the velocity of light c in the latter transformation.
        Aided by the following illustration, we can readily see that, in
        accordance with the Lorentz transformation, the law of the transmission
        of light in vacuo is satisfied both for the reference-body K and for the
        reference-body K1. A light-signal is sent along the positive xaxis, and
        this light-stimulus advances in accordance with the equation x = ct,
        i.e. with the velocity c. According to the equations of the Lorentz
        transformation, this simple relation between x and t involves a relation
        between x1 and t1. In point of fact, if we Albert Einstein 32 Part I:
        The Special Theory of Relativity substitute for x the value ct in the
        first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation, we obtain:
        from which, by division, the expression x1 = ct1 immediately follows. If
        referred to the system K1, the propagation of light takes place
        according to this equation. We thus see that the velocity of
        transmission relative to the reference-body K1 is also equal to c. The
        same result is obtained for rays of light advancing in any other
        direction whatsoever. Of cause this is not surprising, since the
        equations of the Lorentz transformation were derived conformably to this
        point of view. Footnotes 1) A simple derivation of the Lorentz
        transformation is given in Appendix I. Albert Einstein 33 Part I: The
        Special Theory of Relativity The Behaviour of Measuring-Rods and Clocks
        in Motion Place a metre-rod in the x1-axis of K1 in such a manner that
        one end (the beginning) coincides with the point x1=0 whilst the other
        end (the end of the rod) coincides with the point x1=I. What is the
        length of the metre-rod relatively to the system K? In order to learn
        this, we need only ask where the beginning of the rod and the end of the
        rod lie with respect to K at a particular time t of the system K. By
        means of the first equation of the Lorentz transformation the values of
        these two points at the time t = 0 can be shown to be the distance
        between the points being . But the metre-rod is moving with the velocity
        v relative to K. It therefore follows that the length of a rigid
        metre-rod moving in the direction of its length with a velocity v is of
        a metre. The rigid rod is thus shorter when in motion than when at rest,
        and the more quickly it is moving, the shorter is the rod. For the
        velocity v=c we should have , Albert Einstein 34 Part I: The Special
        Theory of Relativity and for stiII greater velocities the square-root
        becomes imaginary. From this we conclude that in the theory of
        relativity the velocity c plays the part of a limiting velocity, which
        can neither be reached nor exceeded by any real body. Of course this
        feature of the velocity c as a limiting velocity also clearly follows
        from the equations of the Lorentz transformation, for these became
        meaningless if we choose values of v greater than c. If, on the
        contrary, we had considered a metre-rod at rest in the x-axis with
        respect to K, then we should have found that the length of the rod as
        judged from K1 would have been ; this is quite in accordance with the
        principle of relativity which forms the basis of our considerations. A
        Priori it is quite clear that we must be able to learn something about
        the physical behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks from the equations
        of transformation, for the magnitudes z, y, x, t, are nothing more nor
        less than the results of measurements obtainable by means of
        measuring-rods and clocks. If we had based our considerations on the
        Galileian transformation we should not have obtained a contraction of
        the rod as a consequence of its motion. Let us now consider a
        seconds-clock which is permanently situated at the origin (x1=0) of K1.
        t1=0 and t1=I are two successive ticks of this clock. The first and
        fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation give for these two ticks
        : t=0 and Albert Einstein 35 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity As
        judged from K, the clock is moving with the velocity v; as judged from
        this referencebody, the time which elapses between two strokes of the
        clock is not one second, but seconds, i.e. a somewhat larger time. As a
        consequence of its motion the clock goes more slowly than when at rest.
        Here also the velocity c plays the part of an unattainable limiting
        velocity. Albert Einstein 36 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity
        Theorem of the Addition of Velocities. The Experiment of Fizeau Now in
        practice we can move clocks and measuring-rods only with velocities that
        are small compared with the velocity of light; hence we shall hardly be
        able to compare the results of the previous section directly with the
        reality. But, on the other hand, these results must strike you as being
        very singular, and for that reason I shall now draw another conclusion
        from the theory, one which can easily be derived from the foregoing
        considerations, and which has been most elegantly confirmed by
        experiment. In Section 6 we derived the theorem of the addition of
        velocities in one direction in the form which also results from the
        hypotheses of classical mechanics- This theorem can also be deduced
        readily horn the Galilei transformation (Section 11). In place of the
        man walking inside the carriage, we introduce a point moving relatively
        to the co-ordinate system K1 in accordance with the equation x1 = wt1 By
        means of the first and fourth equations of the Galilei transformation we
        can express x1 and t1 in terms of x and t, and we then obtain x = (v +
        w)t This equation expresses nothing else than the law of motion of the
        point with reference to the system K (of the man with reference to the
        embankment). We denote this velocity by the symbol W, and we then
        obtain, as in Section 6, W=v+w A) Albert Einstein 37 Part I: The Special
        Theory of Relativity But we can carry out this consideration just as
        well on the basis of the theory of relativity. In the equation x1 = wt1
        B) we must then express x1and t1 in terms of x and t, making use of the
        first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation. Instead of the
        equation (A) we then obtain the equation which corresponds to the
        theorem of addition for velocities in one direction according to the
        theory of relativity. The question now arises as to which of these two
        theorems is the better in accord with experience. On this point we axe
        enlightened by a most important experiment which the brilliant physicist
        Fizeau performed more than half a century ago, and which has been
        repeated since then by some of the best experimental physicists, so that
        there can be no doubt about its result. The experiment is concerned with
        the following question. Light travels in a motionless liquid with a
        particular velocity w. How quickly does it travel in the direction of
        the arrow in the tube T (see the accompanying diagram, Fig. 3) when the
        liquid above mentioned is flowing through the tube with a velocity v ?
        In accordance with the principle of relativity we shall certainly have
        to take for granted that the propagation of light always takes place
        with the same velocity w with respect to the liquid, whether the latter
        is in motion with reference to other bodies or not. The velocity of
        light relative to the liquid and the velocity of the latter relative to
        the tube are thus known, and we require the velocity of light relative
        to the tube. It is clear that we have the problem of Section 6 again
        before us. The tube plays the part of the railway embankment or of the
        co-ordinate system K, the liquid plays the part of the carriage or of
        the co-ordinate system K1, and finally, the light plays the part of the
        Albert Einstein 38 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity man walking
        along the carriage, or of the moving point in the present section. If we
        denote the velocity of the light relative to the tube by W, then this is
        given by the equation (A) or (B), according as the Galilei
        transformation or the Lorentz transformation corresponds to the facts.
        Experiment1) decides in favour of equation (B) derived from the theory
        of relativity, and the agreement is, indeed, very exact. According to
        recent and most excellent measurements by Zeeman, the influence of the
        velocity of flow v on the propagation of light is represented by formula
        (B) to within one per cent. Nevertheless we must now draw attention to
        the fact that a theory of this phenomenon was given by H. A. Lorentz
        long before the statement of the theory of relativity. This theory was
        of a purely electrodynamical nature, and was obtained by the use of
        particular hypotheses as to the electromagnetic structure of matter.
        This circumstance, however, does not in the least diminish the
        conclusiveness of the experiment as a crucial test in favour of the
        theory of relativity, for the electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz, on
        which the original theory was based, in no way opposes the theory of
        relativity. Rather has the latter been developed trom electrodynamics as
        an astoundingly simple combination and generalisation of the hypotheses,
        formerly independent of each other, on which electrodynamics was built.
        Footnotes 1) Fizeau found , where Albert Einstein 39 Part I: The Special
        Theory of Relativity is the index of refraction of the liquid. On the
        other hand, owing to the smallness of as compared with I, we can replace
        (B) in the first place by , or to the same order of approximation by ,
        which agrees with Fizeau's result. Albert Einstein 40 Part I: The
        Special Theory of Relativity The Heuristic Value of the Theory of
        Relativity Our train of thought in the foregoing pages can be epitomised
        in the following manner. Experience has led to the conviction that, on
        the one hand, the principle of relativity holds true and that on the
        other hand the velocity of transmission of light in vacuo has to be
        considered equal to a constant c. By uniting these two postulates we
        obtained the law of transformation for the rectangular co-ordinates x,
        y, z and the time t of the events which constitute the processes of
        nature. In this connection we did not obtain the Galilei transformation,
        but, differing from classical mechanics, the Lorentz transformation. The
        law of transmission of light, the acceptance of which is justified by
        our actual knowledge, played an important part in this process of
        thought. Once in possession of the Lorentz transformation, however, we
        can combine this with the principle of relativity, and sum up the theory
        thus: Every general law of nature must be so constituted that it is
        transformed into a law of exactly the same form when, instead of the
        space-time variables x, y, z, t of the original coordinate system K, we
        introduce new space-time variables x1, y1, z1, t1 of a co-ordinate
        system K1. In this connection the relation between the ordinary and the
        accented magnitudes is given by the Lorentz transformation. Or in brief
        : General laws of nature are co-variant with respect to Lorentz
        transformations. This is a definite mathematical condition that the
        theory of relativity demands of a natural law, and in virtue of this,
        the theory becomes a valuable heuristic aid in the search for general
        laws of nature. If a general law of nature were to be found which did
        not satisfy this condition, then at least one of the two fundamental
        assumptions of the theory would have been disproved. Let us now examine
        what general results the latter theory has hitherto evinced. Albert
        Einstein 41 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity General Results of
        the Theory It is clear from our previous considerations that the
        (special) theory of relativity has grown out of electrodynamics and
        optics. In these fields it has not appreciably altered the predictions
        of theory, but it has considerably simplified the theoretical structure,
        i.e. the derivation of laws, and — what is incomparably more important —
        it has considerably reduced the number of independent hypothese forming
        the basis of theory. The special theory of relativity has rendered the
        Maxwell-Lorentz theory so plausible, that the latter would have been
        generally accepted by physicists even if experiment had decided less
        unequivocally in its favour. Classical mechanics required to be modified
        before it could come into line with the demands of the special theory of
        relativity. For the main part, however, this modification affects only
        the laws for rapid motions, in which the velocities of matter v are not
        very small as compared with the velocity of light. We have experience of
        such rapid motions only in the case of electrons and ions; for other
        motions the variations from the laws of classical mechanics are too
        small to make themselves evident in practice. We shall not consider the
        motion of stars until we come to speak of the general theory of
        relativity. In accordance with the theory of relativity the kinetic
        energy of a material point of mass m is no longer given by the
        well-known expression but by the expression Albert Einstein 42 Part I:
        The Special Theory of Relativity This expression approaches infinity as
        the velocity v approaches the velocity of light c. The velocity must
        therefore always remain less than c, however great may be the energies
        used to produce the acceleration. If we develop the expression for the
        kinetic energy in the form of a series, we obtain When is small compared
        with unity, the third of these terms is always small in comparison with
        the second, which last is alone considered in classical mechanics. The
        first term mc2 does not contain the velocity, and requires no
        consideration if we are only dealing with the question as to how the
        energy of a point-mass; depends on the velocity. We shall speak of its
        essential significance later. The most important result of a general
        character to which the special theory of relativity has led is concerned
        with the conception of mass. Before the advent of relativity, physics
        recognised two conservation laws of fundamental importance, namely, the
        law of the canservation of energy and the law of the conservation of
        mass these two fundamental laws appeared to be quite independent of each
        other. By means of the theory of relativity they have been united into
        one law. We shall now briefly consider how this unification came about,
        and what meaning is to be attached to it. The principle of relativity
        requires that the law of the concervation of energy should hold not only
        with reference to a co-ordinate system K, but also with respect to every
        co-ordinate system K1 which is in a state of uniform motion of
        translation relative to K, or, briefly, relative to every " Galileian "
        system of co-ordinates. In contrast to classical mechanics; the Lorentz
        transformation is the deciding factor in the transition from one such
        system to another. Albert Einstein 43 Part I: The Special Theory of
        Relativity By means of comparatively simple considerations we are led to
        draw the following conclusion from these premises, in conjunction with
        the fundamental equations of the electrodynamics of Maxwell: A body
        moving with the velocity v, which absorbs 1) an amount of energy E0 in
        the form of radiation without suffering an alteration in velocity in the
        process, has, as a consequence, its energy increased by an amount In
        consideration of the expression given above for the kinetic energy of
        the body, the required energy of the body comes out to be Thus the body
        has the same energy as a body of mass moving with the velocity v. Hence
        we can say: If a body takes up an amount of energy E0, then its inertial
        mass increases by an amount the inertial mass of a body is not a
        constant but varies according to the change in the energy of the body.
        The inertial mass of a system of bodies can even be regarded as a
        measure of its energy. The law of the conservation of the mass of a
        system becomes identical with the Albert Einstein 44 Part I: The Special
        Theory of Relativity law of the conservation of energy, and is only
        valid provided that the system neither takes up nor sends out energy.
        Writing the expression for the energy in the form we see that the term
        mc2, which has hitherto attracted our attention, is nothing else than
        the energy possessed by the body 2) before it absorbed the energy E0. A
        direct comparison of this relation with experiment is not possible at
        the present time (1920; see Note, p. 48), owing to the fact that the
        changes in energy E0 to which we can Subject a system are not large
        enough to make themselves perceptible as a change in the inertial mass
        of the system. is too small in comparison with the mass m, which was
        present before the alteration of the energy. It is owing to this
        circumstance that classical mechanics was able to establish successfully
        the conservation of mass as a law of independent validity. Let me add a
        final remark of a fundamental nature. The success of the Faraday-Maxwell
        interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance resulted in
        physicists becoming convinced that there are no such things as
        instantaneous actions at a distance (not involving an intermediary
        medium) of the type of Newton's law of gravitation. According to the
        theory of relativity, action at a distance with the velocity of light
        always takes the place of instantaneous action at a distance or of
        action at a distance with an infinite velocity of transmission. This is
        connected with the fact that the velocity c plays a fundamental role in
        this theory. In Part II we shall see in what way this result becomes
        modified in the general theory of relativity. Albert Einstein 45 Part I:
        The Special Theory of Relativity Footnotes 1) E0 is the energy taken up,
        as judged from a co-ordinate system moving with the body. 2) As judged
        from a co-ordinate system moving with the body. [Note] The equation E =
        mc2 has been thoroughly proved time and again since this time. Albert
        Einstein 46 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity Experience and the
        Special Theory of Relativity To what extent is the special theory of
        relativity supported by experience ? This question is not easily
        answered for the reason already mentioned in connection with the
        fundamental experiment of Fizeau. The special theory of relativity has
        crystallised out from the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electromagnetic
        phenomena. Thus all facts of experience which support the
        electromagnetic theory also support the theory of relativity. As being
        of particular importance, I mention here the fact that the theory of
        relativity enables us to predict the effects produced on the light
        reaching us from the fixed stars. These results are obtained in an
        exceedingly simple manner, and the effects indicated, which are due to
        the relative motion of the earth with reference to those fixed stars are
        found to be in accord with experience. We refer to the yearly movement
        of the apparent position of the fixed stars resulting from the motion of
        the earth round the sun (aberration), and to the influence of the radial
        components of the relative motions of the fixed stars with respect to
        the earth on the colour of the light reaching us from them. The latter
        effect manifests itself in a slight displacement of the spectral lines
        of the light transmitted to us from a fixed star, as compared with the
        position of the same spectral lines when they are produced by a
        terrestrial source of light (Doppler principle). The experimental
        arguments in favour of the Maxwell-Lorentz theory, which are at the same
        time arguments in favour of the theory of relativity, are too numerous
        to be set forth here. In reality they limit the theoretical
        possibilities to such an extent, that no other theory than that of
        Maxwell and Lorentz has been able to hold its own when tested by
        experience. But there are two classes of experimental facts hitherto
        obtained which can be represented in the Maxwell-Lorentz theory only by
        the introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis, which in itself — i.e.
        without making use of the theory of relativity — appears extraneous.
        Albert Einstein 47 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity It is known
        that cathode rays and the so-called _-rays emitted by radioactive
        substances consist of negatively electrified particles (electrons) of
        very small inertia and large velocity. By examining the deflection of
        these rays under the influence of electric and magnetic fields, we can
        study the law of motion of these particles very exactly. In the
        theoretical treatment of these electrons, we are faced with the
        difficulty that electrodynamic theory of itself is unable to give an
        account of their nature. For since electrical masses of one sign repel
        each other, the negative electrical masses constituting the electron
        would necessarily be scattered under the influence of their mutual
        repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind operating between
        them, the nature of which has hitherto remained obscure to us.1) If we
        now assume that the relative distances between the electrical masses
        constituting the electron remain unchanged during the motion of the
        electron (rigid connection in the sense of classical mechanics), we
        arrive at a law of motion of the electron which does not agree with
        experience. Guided by purely formal points of view, H. A. Lorentz was
        the first to introduce the hypothesis that the form of the electron
        experiences a contraction in the direction of motion in consequence of
        that motion. the contracted length being proportional to the expression
        This, hypothesis, which is not justifiable by any electrodynamical
        facts, supplies us then with that particular law of motion which has
        been confirmed with great precision in recent years. The theory of
        relativity leads to the same law of motion, without requiring any
        special hypothesis whatsoever as to the structure and the behaviour of
        the electron. We arrived at a similar conclusion in Section 13 in
        connection with the experiment of Fizeau, the result of which is
        foretold by the theory of relativity without the necessity of drawing on
        hypotheses as to the physical nature of the liquid. The second class of
        facts to which we have alluded has reference to the question whether or
        not the motion of the earth in space can be made perceptible in
        terrestrial experiments. We have already remarked in Section 5 that all
        attempts of this nature led to a negative Albert Einstein 48 Part I: The
        Special Theory of Relativity result. Before the theory of relativity was
        put forward, it was difficult to become reconciled to this negative
        result, for reasons now to be discussed. The inherited prejudices about
        time and space did not allow any doubt to arise as to the prime
        importance of the Galileian transformation for changing over from one
        body of reference to another. Now assuming that the Maxwell-Lorentz
        equations hold for a reference-body K, we then find that they do not
        hold for a reference-body K1 moving uniformly with respect to K, if we
        assume that the relations of the Galileian transformstion exist between
        the co-ordinates of K and K1. It thus appears that, of all Galileian
        co-ordinate systems, one (K) corresponding to a particular state of
        motion is physically unique. This result was interpreted physically by
        regarding K as at rest with respect to a hypothetical æther of space. On
        the other hand, all coordinate systems K1 moving relatively to K were to
        be regarded as in motion with respect to the æther. To this motion of K1
        against the æther ("æther-drift " relative to K1) were attributed the
        more complicated laws which were supposed to hold relative to K1.
        Strictly speaking, such an æther-drift ought also to be assumed relative
        to the earth, and for a long time the efforts of physicists were devoted
        to attempts to detect the existence of an æther-drift at the earth's
        surface. In one of the most notable of these attempts Michelson devised
        a method which appears as though it must be decisive. Imagine two
        mirrors so arranged on a rigid body that the reflecting surfaces face
        each other. A ray of light requires a perfectly definite time T to pass
        from one mirror to the other and back again, if the whole system be at
        rest with respect to the æther. It is found by calculation, however,
        that a slightly different time T1 is required for this process, if the
        body, together with the mirrors, be moving relatively to the æther. And
        yet another point: it is shown by calculation that for a given velocity
        v with reference to the æther, this time T1 is different when the body
        is moving perpendicularly to the planes of the mirrors from that
        resulting when the motion is parallel to these planes. Although the
        estimated difference between these two times is exceedingly small,
        Michelson and Morley performed an experiment involving interference in
        which this difference should have been clearly detectable. But the
        experiment gave a negative result — a fact very perplexing to
        physicists. Lorentz and FitzGerald rescued the theory from this
        difficulty by assuming that the motion of the body relative to the æther
        produces a contraction of the body in the direction of motion, the
        amount of contraction being just sufficient to compensate for the
        differeace in time mentioned above. Comparison with the discussion in
        Section 11 shows Albert Einstein 49 Part I: The Special Theory of
        Relativity that also from the standpoint of the theory of relativity
        this solution of the difficulty was the right one. But on the basis of
        the theory of relativity the method of interpretation is incomparably
        more satisfactory. According to this theory there is no such thing as a
        " specially favoured " (unique) co-ordinate system to occasion the
        introduction of the ætheridea, and hence there can be no æther-drift,
        nor any experiment with which to demonstrate it. Here the contraction of
        moving bodies follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory,
        without the introduction of particular hypotheses ; and as the prime
        factor involved in this contraction we find, not the motion in itself,
        to which we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion with respect to
        the body of reference chosen in the particular case in point. Thus for a
        co-ordinate system moving with the earth the mirror system of Michelson
        and Morley is not shortened, but it is shortened for a co-ordinate
        system which is at rest relatively to the sun. Footnotes 1) The general
        theory of relativity renders it likely that the electrical masses of an
        electron are held together by gravitational forces. Albert Einstein 50
        Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity Minkowski's Four-Dimensional
        Space The non-mathematician is seized by a mysterious shuddering when he
        hears of "fourdimensional" things, by a feeling not unlike that awakened
        by thoughts of the occult. And yet there is no more common-place
        statement than that the world in which we live is a fourdimensional
        space-time continuum. Space is a three-dimensional continuum. By this we
        mean that it is possible to describe the position of a point (at rest)
        by means of three numbers (co-ordinales) x, y, z, and that there is an
        indefinite number of points in the neighbourhood of this one, the
        position of which can be described by co-ordinates such as x1, y1, z1,
        which may be as near as we choose to the respective values of the
        co-ordinates x, y, z, of the first point. In virtue of the latter
        property we speak of a " continuum," and owing to the fact that there
        are three coordinates we speak of it as being " three-dimensional."
        Similarly, the world of physical phenomena which was briefly called "
        world " by Minkowski is naturally four dimensional in the space-time
        sense. For it is composed of individual events, each of which is
        described by four numbers, namely, three space coordinates x, y, z, and
        a time co-ordinate, the time value t. The" world" is in this sense also
        a continuum; for to every event there are as many "neighbouring" events
        (realised or at least thinkable) as we care to choose, the co-ordinates
        x1, y1, z1, t1 of which differ by an indefinitely small amount from
        those of the event x, y, z, t originally considered. That we have not
        been accustomed to regard the world in this sense as a four-dimensional
        continuum is due to the fact that in physics, before the advent of the
        theory of relativity, time played a different and more independent role,
        as compared with the space coordinates. It is for this reason that we
        have been in the habit of treating time as an independent continuum. As
        a matter of fact, according to classical mechanics, time is absolute,
        i.e. it is Albert Einstein 51 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity
        independent of the position and the condition of motion of the system of
        co-ordinates. We see this expressed in the last equation of the
        Galileian transformation (t1 = t) The four-dimensional mode of
        consideration of the "world" is natural on the theory of relativity,
        since according to this theory time is robbed of its independence. This
        is shown by the fourth equation of the Lorentz transformation: Moreover,
        according to this equation the time difference _t1 of two events with
        respect to K1 does not in general vanish, even when the time difference
        _t1 of the same events with reference to K vanishes. Pure "
        space-distance " of two events with respect to K results in "
        time-distance " of the same events with respect to K. But the discovery
        of Minkowski, which was of importance for the formal development of the
        theory of relativity, does not lie here. It is to be found rather in the
        fact of his recognition that the four-dimensional spacetime continuum of
        the theory of relativity, in its most essential formal properties, shows
        a pronounced relationship to the three-dimensional continuum of
        Euclidean geometrical space.1) In order to give due prominence to this
        relationship, however, we must replace the usual time co-ordinate t by
        an imaginary magnitude proportional to it. Under these conditions, the
        natural laws satisfying the demands of the (special) theory of
        relativity assume mathematical forms, in which the time co-ordinate
        plays exactly the same role as the three space co-ordinates. Formally,
        these four co-ordinates correspond exactly to the three space
        co-ordinates in Euclidean geometry. It must be clear even to the
        nonmathematician that, as a consequence of this purely formal addition
        to our knowledge, the theory perforce gained clearness in no mean
        measure. These inadequate remarks can give the reader only a vague
        notion of the important idea contributed by Minkowski. Without it the
        general theory of relativity, of which the fundamental ideas are
        developed in the following pages, would perhaps have got no farther
        Albert Einstein 52 Part I: The Special Theory of Relativity than its
        long clothes. Minkowski's work is doubtless difficult of access to
        anyone inexperienced in mathematics, but since it is not necessary to
        have a very exact grasp of this work in order to understand the
        fundamental ideas of either the special or the general theory of
        relativity, I shall leave it here at present, and revert to it only
        towards the end of Part 2. Footnotes 1) Cf. the somewhat more detailed
        discussion in Appendix II. Albert Einstein 53 Part II: The General
        Theory of Relativity Part II The General Theory of Relativity Special
        and General Principle of Relativity The basal principle, which was the
        pivot of all our previous considerations, was the special principle of
        relativity, i.e. the principle of the physical relativity of all uniform
        motion. Let as once more analyse its meaning carefully. It was at all
        times clear that, from the point of view of the idea it conveys to us,
        every motion must be considered only as a relative motion. Returning to
        the illustration we have frequently used of the embankment and the
        railway carriage, we can express the fact of the motion here taking
        place in the following two forms, both of which are equally justifiable
        : (a) The carriage is in motion relative to the embankment, (b) The
        embankment is in motion relative to the carriage. In (a) the embankment,
        in (b) the carriage, serves as the body of reference in our statement of
        the motion taking place. If it is simply a question of detecting or of
        describing the motion involved, it is in principle immaterial to what
        reference-body we refer the motion. As already mentioned, this is
        self-evident, but it must not be confused with the much more
        comprehensive statement called "the principle of relativity," which we
        have taken as the basis of our investigations. Albert Einstein 54 Part
        II: The General Theory of Relativity The principle we have made use of
        not only maintains that we may equally well choose the carriage or the
        embankment as our reference-body for the description of any event (for
        this, too, is self-evident). Our principle rather asserts what follows :
        If we formulate the general laws of nature as they are obtained from
        experience, by making use of (a) the embankment as reference-body, (b)
        the railway carriage as reference-body, then these general laws of
        nature (e.g. the laws of mechanics or the law of the propagation of
        light in vacuo) have exactly the same form in both cases. This can also
        be expressed as follows : For the physical description of natural
        processes, neither of the reference bodies K, K1 is unique (lit. "
        specially marked out ") as compared with the other. Unlike the first,
        this latter statement need not of necessity hold a priori; it is not
        contained in the conceptions of " motion" and " reference-body " and
        derivable from them; only experience can decide as to its correctness or
        incorrectness. Up to the present, however, we have by no means
        maintained the equivalence of all bodies of reference K in connection
        with the formulation of natural laws. Our course was more on the
        following Iines. In the first place, we started out from the assumption
        that there exists a reference-body K, whose condition of motion is such
        that the Galileian law holds with respect to it : A particle left to
        itself and sufficiently far removed from all other particles moves
        uniformly in a straight line. With reference to K (Galileian
        reference-body) the laws of nature were to be as simple as possible. But
        in addition to K, all bodies of reference K1 should be given preference
        in this sense, and they should be exactly equivalent to K for the
        formulation of natural laws, provided that they are in a state of
        uniform rectilinear and non-rotary motion with respect to K ; all these
        bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galileian reference-bodies.
        The validity of the principle of relativity was assumed only for these
        reference-bodies, but not for others (e.g. those possessing motion of a
        different kind). In this sense we speak of the special principle of
        relativity, or special theory of relativity. In contrast to this we wish
        to understand by the "general principle of relativity" the following
        statement : All bodies of reference K, K1, etc., are equivalent for the
        description of natural phenomena (formulation of the general laws of
        nature), whatever may be their Albert Einstein 55 Part II: The General
        Theory of Relativity state of motion. But before proceeding farther, it
        ought to be pointed out that this formulation must be replaced later by
        a more abstract one, for reasons which will become evident at a later
        stage. Since the introduction of the special principle of relativity has
        been justified, every intellect which strives after generalisation must
        feel the temptation to venture the step towards the general principle of
        relativity. But a simple and apparently quite reliable consideration
        seems to suggest that, for the present at any rate, there is little hope
        of success in such an attempt; Let us imagine ourselves transferred to
        our old friend the railway carriage, which is travelling at a uniform
        rate. As long as it is moving unifromly, the occupant of the carriage is
        not sensible of its motion, and it is for this reason that he can
        without reluctance interpret the facts of the case as indicating that
        the carriage is at rest, but the embankment in motion. Moreover,
        according to the special principle of relativity, this interpretation is
        quite justified also from a physical point of view. If the motion of the
        carriage is now changed into a non-uniform motion, as for instance by a
        powerful application of the brakes, then the occupant of the carriage
        experiences a correspondingly powerful jerk forwards. The retarded
        motion is manifested in the mechanical behaviour of bodies relative to
        the person in the railway carriage. The mechanical behaviour is
        different from that of the case previously considered, and for this
        reason it would appear to be impossible that the same mechanical laws
        hold relatively to the non-uniformly moving carriage, as hold with
        reference to the carriage when at rest or in uniform motion. At all
        events it is clear that the Galileian law does not hold with respect to
        the non-uniformly moving carriage. Because of this, we feel compelled at
        the present juncture to grant a kind of absolute physical reality to
        non-uniform motion, in opposition to the general principle of relatvity.
        But in what follows we shall soon see that this conclusion cannot be
        maintained. Albert Einstein 56 Part II: The General Theory of Relativity
        The Gravitational Field "If we pick up a stone and then let it go, why
        does it fall to the ground ?" The usual answer to this question is:
        "Because it is attracted by the earth." Modern physics formulates the
        answer rather differently for the following reason. As a result of the
        more careful study of electromagnetic phenomena, we have come to regard
        action at a distance as a process impossible without the intervention of
        some intermediary medium. If, for instance, a magnet attracts a piece of
        iron, we cannot be content to regard this as meaning that the magnet
        acts directly on the iron through the intermediate empty space, but we
        are constrained to imagine — after the manner of Faraday — that the
        magnet always calls into being something physically real in the space
        around it, that something being what we call a "magnetic field." In its
        turn this magnetic field operates on the piece of iron, so that the
        latter strives to move towards the magnet. We shall not discuss here the
        justification for this incidental conception, which is indeed a somewhat
        arbitrary one. We shall only mention that with its aid electromagnetic
        phenomena can be theoretically represented much more satisfactorily than
        without it, and this applies particularly to the transmission of
        electromagnetic waves. The effects of gravitation also are regarded in
        an analogous manner. The action of the earth on the stone takes place
        indirectly. The earth produces in its surrounding a gravitational field,
        which acts on the stone and produces its motion of fall. As we know from
        experience, the intensity of the action on a body dimishes according to
        a quite definite law, as we proceed farther and farther away from the
        earth. From our point of view this means : The law governing the
        properties of the gravitational field in space must be a perfectly
        definite one, in order correctly to represent the diminution of
        gravitational action with the distance from operative bodies. It is
        something like this: The body (e.g. the earth) produces a field in its
        immediate neighbourhood directly; the intensity and direction of the
        field at points farther removed from the body are thence determined by
        the law which governs the properties in space of the gravitational
        fields themselves. Albert Einstein 57 Part II: The General Theory of
        Relativity In contrast to electric and magnetic fields, the
        gravitational field exhibits a most remarkable property, which is of
        fundamental importance for what follows. Bodies which are moving under
        the sole influence of a gravitational field receive an acceleration,
        which does not in the least depend either on the material or on the
        physical state of the body. For instance, a piece of lead and a piece of
        wood fall in exactly the same manner in a gravitational field (in
        vacuo), when they start off from rest or with the same initial velocity.
        This law, which holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different
        form in the light of the following consideration. According to Newton's
        law of motion, we have (Force) = (inertial mass) x (acceleration), where
        the "inertial mass" is a characteristic constant of the accelerated
        body. If now gravitation is the cause of the acceleration, we then have
        (Force) = (gravitational mass) x (intensity of the gravitational field),
        where the "gravitational mass" is likewise a characteristic constant for
        the body. From these two relations follows: If now, as we find from
        experience, the acceleration is to be independent of the nature and the
        condition of the body and always the same for a given gravitational
        field, then the ratio of the gravitational to the inertial mass must
        likewise be the same for all bodies. By a suitable choice of units we
        can thus make this ratio equal to unity. We then have the following law:
        The gravitational mass of a body is equal to its inertial law. It is
        true that this important law had hitherto been recorded in mechanics,
        but it had not been interpreted. A satisfactory interpretation can be
        obtained only if we recognise the following fact : The same quality of a
        body manifests itself according to circumstances as " Albert Einstein 58
        Part II: The General Theory of Relativity inertia " or as " weight "
        (lit. " heaviness '). In the following section we shall show to what
        extent this is actually the case, and how this question is connected
        with the general postulate of relativity. Albert Einstein 59 Part II:
        The General Theory of Relativity The Equality of Inertial and
        Gravitational Mass as an argument for the General Postule of Relativity
        We imagine a large portion of empty space, so far removed from stars and
        other appreciable masses, that we have before us approximately the
        conditions required by the fundamental law of Galilei. It is then
        possible to choose a Galileian reference-body for this part of space
        (world), relative to which points at rest remain at rest and points in
        motion continue permanently in uniform rectilinear motion. As
        reference-body let us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with an
        observer inside who is equipped with apparatus. Gravitation naturally
        does not exist for this observer. He must fasten himself with strings to
        the floor, otherwise the slightest impact against the floor will cause
        him to rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room. To the middle of the
        lid of the chest is fixed externally a hook with rope attached, and now
        a " being " (what kind of a being is immaterial to us) begins pulling at
        this with a constant force. The chest together with the observer then
        begin to move "upwards" with a uniformly accelerated motion. In course
        of time their velocity will reach unheard-of values — provided that we
        are viewing all this from another reference-body which is not being
        pulled with a rope. But how does the man in the chest regard the Process
        ? The acceleration of the chest will be transmitted to him by the
        reaction of the floor of the chest. He must therefore take up this
        pressure by means of his legs if he does not wish to be laid out full
        length on the floor. He is then standing in the chest in exactly the
        same way as anyone stands in a room of a home on our earth. If he
        releases a body which he previously had in his land, the accelertion of
        the Albert Einstein 60 Part II: The General Theory of Relativity chest
        will no longer be transmitted to this body, and for this reason the body
        will approach the floor of the chest with an accelerated relative
        motion. The observer will further convince himself that the acceleration
        of the body towards the floor of the chest is always of the same
        magnitude, whatever kind of body he may happen to use for the
        experiment. Relying on his knowledge of the gravitational field (as it
        was discussed in the preceding section), the man in the chest will thus
        come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational
        field which is constant with regard to time. Of course he will be
        puzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this
        gravitational field. just then, however, he discovers the hook in the
        middle of the lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to it, and
        he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chest is suspended at
        rest in the gravitational field. Ought we to smile at the man and say
        that he errs in his conclusion ? I do not believe we ought to if we wish
        to remain consistent ; we must rather admit that his mode of grasping
        the situation violates neither reason nor known mechanical laws. Even
        though it is being accelerated with respect to the "Galileian space"
        first considered, we can nevertheless regard the chest as being at rest.
        We have thus good grounds for extending the principle of relativity to
        include bodies of reference which are accelerated with respect to each
        other, and as a result we have gained a powerful argument for a
        generalised postulate of relativity. We must note carefully that the
        possibility of this mode of interpretation rests on the fundamental
        property of the gravitational field of giving all bodies the same
        acceleration, or, what comes to the same thing, on the law of the
        equality of inertial and gravitational mass. If this natural law did not
        exist, the man in the accelerated chest would not be able to interpret
        the behaviour of the bodies around him on the supposition of a
        gravitational field, and he would not be justified on the grounds of
        experience in supposing his reference-body to be " at rest." Suppose
        that the man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side of the lid, and
        that he attaches a body to the free end of the rope. The result of this
        will be to strech the rope so that it will hang " vertically "
        downwards. If we ask for an opinion of the cause of tension in the rope,
        the man in the chest will say: "The suspended body experiences a
        downward force in the gravitational field, and this is neutralised by
        the tension of the rope ; what determines Albert Einstein 61 Part II:
        The General Theory of Relativity the magnitude of the tension of the
        rope is the gravitational mass of the suspended body." On the other
        hand, an observer who is poised freely in space will interpret the
        condition of things thus : " The rope must perforce take part in the
        accelerated motion of the chest, and it transmits this motion to the
        body attached to it. The tension of the rope is just large enough to
        effect the acceleration of the body. That which determines the magnitude
        of the tension of the rope is the inertial mass of the body." Guided by
        this example, we see that our extension of the principle of relativity
        implies the necessity of the law of the equality of inertial and
        gravitational mass. Thus we have obtained a physical interpretation of
        this law. From our consideration of the accelerated chest we see that a
        general theory of relativity must yield important results on the laws of
        gravitation. In point of fact, the systematic pursuit of the general
        idea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by the gravitational
        field. Before proceeding farther, however, I must warn the reader
        against a misconception suggested by these considerations. A
        gravitational field exists for the man in the chest, despite the fact
        that there was no such field for the co-ordinate system first chosen.
        Now we might easily suppose that the existence of a gravitational field
        is always only an apparent one. We might also think that, regardless of
        the kind of gravitational field which may be present, we could always
        choose another reference-body such that no gravitational field exists
        with reference to it. This is by no means true for all gravitational
        fields, but only for those of quite special form. It is, for instance,
        impossible to choose a body of reference such that, as judged from it,
        the gravitational field of the earth (in its entirety) vanishes. We can
        now appreciate why that argument is not convincing, which we brought
        forward against the general principle of relativity at theend of Section
        18. It is certainly true that the observer in the railway carriage
        experiences a jerk forwards as a result of the application of the brake,
        and that he recognises, in this the non-uniformity of motion
        (retardation) of the carriage. But he is compelled by nobody to refer
        this jerk to a " real " acceleration (retardation) of the carriage. He
        might also interpret his experience thus: " My body of reference (the
        carriage) remains permanently at rest. With reference to it, however,
        there exists (during the period of application of the brakes) a
        gravitational field which is directed forwards and which is variable
        with respect to time. Under the influence of this field, the embankment
        together with the earth moves non-uniformly in such a manner that their
        original velocity in the backwards direction is continuously reduced."
        Albert Einstein 62 Part II: The General Theory of Relativity In What
        Respects are the Foundations of Classical Mechanics and of the Special
        Theory of Relativity Unsatisfactory? We have already stated several
        times that classical mechanics starts out from the following law:
        Material particles sufficiently far removed from other material
        particles continue to move uniformly in a straight line or continue in a
        state of rest. We have also repeatedly emphasised that this fundamental
        law can only be valid for bodies of reference K which possess certain
        unique states of motion, and which are in uniform translational motion
        relative to each other. Relative to other reference-bodies K the law is
        not valid. Both in classical mechanics and in the special theory of
        relativity we therefore differentiate between reference-bodies K
        relative to which the recognised " laws of nature " can be said to hold,
        and reference-bodies K relative to which these laws do not hold. But no
        person whose mode of thought is logical can rest satisfied with this
        condition of things. He asks : " How does it come that certain
        reference-bodies (or their states of motion) are given priority over
        other reference-bodies (or their states of motion) ? What is the reason
        for this Preference? In order to show clearly what I mean by this
        question, I shall make use of a comparison. I am standing in front of a
        gas range. Standing alongside of each other on the range are two pans so
        much alike that one may be mistaken for the other. Both are half full of
        water. I notice that steam is being emitted continuously from the one
        pan, but not from the other. I am surprised at this, even if I have
        never seen either a gas range or a pan before. But if I now notice a
        luminous something of bluish colour under the first pan but not under
        the Albert Einstein 63 Part II: The General Theory of Relativity other,
        I cease to be astonished, even if I have never before seen a gas flame.
        For I can only say that this bluish something will cause the emission of
        the steam, or at least possibly it may do so. If, however, I notice the
        bluish something in neither case, and if I observe that the one
        continuously emits steam whilst the other does not, then I shall remain
        astonished and dissatisfied until I have discovered some circumstance to
        which I can attribute the different behaviour of the two pans.
        Analogously, I seek in vain for a real something in classical mechanics
        (or in the special theory of relativity) to which I can attribute the
        different behaviour of bodies considered with respect to the reference
        systems K and K1.1) Newton saw this objection and attempted to
        invalidate it, but without success. But E. Mach recognsed it most
        clearly of all, and because of this objection he claimed that mechanics
        must be placed on a new basis. It can only be got rid of by means of a
        physics which is conformable to the general principle of relativity,
        since the equations of such a theory hold for every body of reference,
        whatever may be its state of motion. Footnotes 1) The objection is of
        importance more especially when the state of motion of the reference-
        body is of such a nature that it does not require any external agency
        for its maintenance, e.g. in the case when the reference-body is
        rotating uniformly. Albert Einstein 64 Part II: The General Theory of
        Relativity A Few Inferences from the General Principle of Relativity The
        considerations of Section 20 show that the general principle of
        relativity puts us in a position to derive properties of the
        gravitational field in a purely theoretical manner. Let us suppose, for
        instance, that we know the space-time " course " for any natural process
        whatsoever, as regards the manner in which it takes place in the
        Galileian domain relative to a Galileian body of reference K. By means
        of purely theoretical operations (i.e. simply by calculation) we are
        then able to find how this known natural process appears, as seen from a
        reference-body K1 which is accelerated relatively to K. But since a
        gravitational field exists with respect to this new body of reference
        K1, our consideration also teaches us how the gravitational field
        influences the process studied. For example, we learn that a body which
        is in a state of uniform rectilinear motion with respect to K (in
        accordance with the law of Galilei) is executing an accelerated and in
        general curvilinear motion with respect to the accelerated
        reference-body K1 (chest). This acceleration or curvature corresponds to
        the influence on the moving body of the gravitational field prevailing
        relatively to K. It is known that a gravitational field influences the
        movement of bodies in this way, so that our consideration supplies us
        with nothing essentially new. However, we obtain a new result of
        fundamental importance when we carry out the analogous consideration for
        a ray of light. With respect to the Galileian reference-body K, such a
        ray of light is transmitted rectilinearly with the velocity c. It can
        easily be shown that the path of the same ray of light is no longer a
        straight line when we consider it with reference to the accelerated
        chest (reference-body K1). From this we conclude, that, in general, rays
        of light are propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields. In two
        respects this result is of great importance. Albert Einstein 65 Part II:
        The General Theory of Relativity In the first place, it can be compared
        with the reality. Although a detailed examination of the question shows
        that the curvature of light rays required by the general theory of
        relativity is only exceedingly small for the gravitational fields at our
        disposal in practice, its estimated magnitude for light rays passing the
        sun at grazing incidence is nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. This ought
        to manifest itself in the following way. As seen from the earth, certain
        fixed stars appear to be in the neighbourhood of the sun, and are thus
        capable of observation during a total eclipse of the sun. At such times,
        these stars ought to appear to be displaced outwards from the sun by an
        amount indicated above, as compared with their apparent position in the
        sky when the sun is situated at another part of the heavens. The
        examination of the correctness or otherwise of this deduction is a
        problem of the greatest importance, the early solution of which is to be
        expected of astronomers.1) In the second place our result shows that,
        according to the general theory of relativity, the law of the constancy
        of the velocity of light in vacuo, which constitutes one of the two
        fundamental assumptions in the special theory of relativity and to which
        we have already frequently referred, cannot claim any unlimited
        validity. A curvature of rays of light can only take place when the
        velocity of propagation of light varies with position. Now we might
        think that as a consequence of this, the special theory of relativity
        and with it the whole theory of relativity would be laid in the dust.
        But in reality this is not the case. We can only conclude that the
        special theory of relativity cannot claim an unlinlited domain of
        validity ; its results hold only so long as we are able to disregard the
        influences of gravitational fields on the phenomena (e.g. of light).
        Since it has often been contended by opponents of the theory of
        relativity that the special theory of relativity is overthrown by the
        general theory of relativity, it is perhaps advisable to make the facts
        of the case clearer by means of an appropriate comparison. Before the
        development of electrodynamics the laws of electrostatics were looked
        upon as the laws of electricity. At the present time we know that
        electric fields can be derived correctly from electrostatic
        considerations only for the case, which is never strictly realised, in
        which the electrical masses are quite at rest relatively to each other,
        and to the co-ordinate system. Should we be justified in saying that for
        this reason electrostatics is overthrown by the fieldequations of
        Maxwell in electrodynamics ? Not in the least. Electrostatics is
        contained in electrodynamics as a limiting case ; the laws of the latter
        lead directly to those of the former Albert Einstein 66 Part II: The
        General Theory of Relativity for the case in which the fields are
        invariable with regard to time. No fairer destiny could be allotted to
        any physical theory, than that it should of itself point out the way to
        the introduction of a more comprehensive theory, in which it lives on as
        a limiting case. In the example of the transmission of light just dealt
        with, we have seen that the general theory of relativity enables us to
        derive theoretically the influence of a gravitational field on the
        course of natural processes, the Iaws of which are already known when a
        gravitational field is absent. But the most attractive problem, to the
        solution of which the general theory of relativity supplies the key,
        concerns the investigation of the laws satisfied by the gravitational
        field itself. Let us consider this for a moment. We are acquainted with
        space-time domains which behave (approximately) in a " Galileian "
        fashion under suitable choice of reference-body, i.e. domains in which
        gravitational fields are absent. If we now refer such a domain to a
        reference-body K1 possessing any kind of motion, then relative to K1
        there exists a gravitational field which is variable with respect to
        space and time.2) The character of this field will of course depend on
        the motion chosen for K1. According to the general theory of relativity,
        the general law of the gravitational field must be satisfied for all
        gravitational fields obtainable in this way. Even though by no means all
        gravitationial fields can be produced in this way, yet we may entertain
        the hope that the general law of gravitation will be derivable from such
        gravitational fields of a special kind. This hope has been realised in
        the most beautiful manner. But between the clear vision of this goal and
        its actual realisation it was necessary to surmount a serious
        difficulty, and as this lies deep at the root of things, I dare not
        withhold it from the reader. We require to extend our ideas of the
        space-time continuum still farther. Footnotes Albert Einstein 67 Part
